PhyTkPi
=======

A Python-Tkinter based gui for streamlined phylogenetic analysis

Prerequisites: python 2.x, including basic packages like string and, of course, Tkinter; MAFFT and/or Muscle;
RAxML and/or Garli; figtree

To run, open up the ctl file (PhyTkPi.ctl) in a text editor and set the paths to the appropriate programs. Paths must be specified for at least one alignment and one tree building software. If you don't have fig tree, a temporary work around is to place "#" (without quotation marks) as the figtree path. Then just run PhyTkPi.py.
